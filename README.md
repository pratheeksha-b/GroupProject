This project presents an end-to-end Market Basket Analysis on the Online Retail dataset, completed as a collaborative team effort.The project was executed through coordinated teamwork, with clearly defined responsibilities and continuous integration of insights across analytical stages. The workflow includes data cleaning and preparation, exploratory analysis, association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm, SQL-based revenue and customer insights, and Power BI dashboard development. Python was used to identify frequently bought-together products and generate actionable cross-selling rules. SQL analysis provided key business metrics such as top products, high-value customers, geographic performance, and seasonal trends. The Power BI dashboard visually summarizes KPIs, sales trends, and country-wise performance for easy decision-making. Based on combined insights, strategic recommendations were proposed for inventory optimization, pricing consistency, customer segmentation, and seasonal promotions. This repository demonstrates practical application of data analytics for retail business intelligence and strategy.
